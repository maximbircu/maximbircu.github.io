This post aims to introduce you to the huge universe of Machine Learning. It's not a very technical one and serves more as an introduction part for my 2 next posts about Neural Networks and how to use them.

## History

Well, it's used to be that if you want to make a computer do something new you have to program it. This means that you have to know and define each instruction that it should execute step by step to do that for you.

But what if you want the computer to do something you don't know how to do yourself?

Well, this could be a challenge. And this challenge was faced by Arthur Samuel in 1956. He wanted to get the IBM704 computer shown in the picture below bit him at checkers.

IBM704 was a machine that you have to program by feeding magnetic tape into a big drum and even if checkers was a pretty simple game it was not able to run every possible move by trial and error in order to find the best one for winning the game or at least not in a reasonable amount of time.

Otherwise, it could solve the problem using brute force which involves the computer to play out every possible game that could take place after each move to pick that one with the highest winning probability. However, this is not the most creative way to solve the problem but well, a valid one. Unfortunately were not enough resources in 1956 for such an approach. So the first game played by AI was possible thanks to heuristics.

A heuristic is basically a rule of thumb, It may not be exactly right but it's almost always mostly right. In computer science, a heuristic is a computer algorithm that limits brute force searching by selecting solutions that may not be the best but are good enough.

Using heuristics in his algorithm Arthur Samuel become a pioneer of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.

## Machine learning in commercial use

Today machine learning is widely used for commercial purposes by big companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Linkedin etc… 
Probably you never thought about how Facebook or LinkedIn knows who your friends might be, or how Netflix or Amazon suggest the products or movies that you would like to buy or to watch. All this is possible due to the power of machine learning. All these companies are developing algorithms that learn from data rather than being programmed by hand.

Due to these algorithms, we all were able to see the first driving car.

Being able to detect and classify objects in the street is quite important for a self-driving car but we don't know how to write all these programs by hand. However, we can build a machine learning model that will learn to do this.

Nowadays machine learning models are able to detect not only some objects in the pictures, but they are also able to make sense of them. Below are some pictures with labels generated by machine learning models that describe what's happening in the picture.

I bet you asked yourself how Google classifies your photos in different directories and give them meaningful names. Just try to think about how complicated or almost impossible is this by writing a simple program.

## Machine learning in Art

What was a mind explosion for me is when I found that machine learning is also good at art. Below are some pictures generated by a computer.s

## What the hell are these ML models?

So what machine learning actually is. Well, if human beings learn from experience and a computer follows the instructions than machine learning will be something in the middle. This will be an algorithm that is able to learn from experience or to be more correct from data, big amounts of data.

There are 3 types of learning algorithms Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement learning. I'll cover just the first one because it will be used in my 2 next blog posts.

Supervised learning: is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. 
Well, a quite abstract definition that's why let's do an example. I'll ask you to think a bit and answer what's the next number in the picture below.

<img src="{{ site.baseUrl }}/assets/images/posts/introduction-to-machine-learning/induction-example.png" >

Yes! the right answer is 81 and I am happy to let you know that you applied a supervised learning approach to find it. Just stay and think a bit about how you managed to succeed in this task. Most probably you observed a relation between input and output values which in your opinion is `output = input²`. Well, this might be not the right assumption, the right function could be for example output = input² except 9 however the function you've thought about is quite close to the right one cause it will give correct answers to all input numbers except 9. This means that when you thought about input² function you did a function approximation of output = input² except 9 based on the labeled set that I gave you.

So if we conclude supervised learning is nothing else than function approximation. It's when you gather some information from a labeled dataset that helps you label another one. Don't want to go to dip into all this stuff but just want to let you know that Machine Learning problems solved using supervised learning could be divided into classification and regression ones. Classification is when you take a bunch of data as input and map it to a discreet label while regression is when the out to which you map you input values is a real value. You'll see an example of classification in the next 2 posts and here is some more information about regression.

## Conclusion
Machine learning is a new fastly growing powerful field which is able to solve problems that are not an easy task for a human being. Check out my 2 next posts that will bring more light on this topic by some simple practical example.
