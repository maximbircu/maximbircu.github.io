#Just write the about me content below

Hi! I'm Max, a 29-year-old Staff Android Engineer and Tech Lead from Moldova.<br/><br/>
Over the past decade, I've built and scaled Android applications used by millions of users worldwide — from reviving legacy products to leading high-impact architecture initiatives at Crunchyroll.<br/><br/>
My expertise spans Android, backend services, and distributed systems, with a track record of
<ul>
  <li>Driving cross-platform architecture across Android TV, mobile, and Apple platforms.</li>
  <li>Leading multi-team initiatives that improved performance, scalability, and developer productivity.</li>
  <li>Delivering critical features like a unified native player, multiple profiles, and AI-powered localization.</li>
  <li>Building internal tools and frameworks to streamline development, testing, and release processes.</li>
</ul>
I'm passionate about clean architecture, performance optimization, and developer enablement. I enjoy mentoring engineers, shaping technical strategy, and finding elegant solutions to complex problems.<br/><br/>
If you want to talk about architecture, scaling teams, or building something impactful — I'm always open for a good conversation.
