#Just write the about me content below

"Hi! My name is Maxim. I'm a 24-year-old creative software engineer from Moldova.
 I have experience in the development of Android apps using different existing techniques.
 Now I tend to accumulate more experience in the development
 of Backend and Distributed Systems. <br/> <br/> I am a fan of rock music and Unix systems. Also, I got started to
 explore Machine Learning in my spare time. I am a good team player because
 I know the difference between listening and hearing. I am always open to
 the acquisition of new things with great people. I practiced game development
 in the past. I enjoy Hackathons and other similar competitions with exciting ideas and challenges.
 If there's a Hackathon in Moldova, you can see me there."
