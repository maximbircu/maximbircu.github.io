"Hi! My name is Maxim. I'm a 22-year-old creative software engineer from Moldova.
I have experience in development of Android Apps using different existing techniques.
Now I tend to accumulate more experience in the development
of Backend and Distributed Systems. <br/> <br/> I am a fan of rock music and Unix systems. Also, I got started to explore
Machine Learning in my spare time. I am a good teamplayer beacuse
I know the difference between listening and hearing.I am always open for
the acquisition of new things with greate people. I practiced game development
in the past. I enjoy Hackathons and other similar competittions with exciting ideas and chellenges.
If there's a Hackathon in Moldova you can see me there."
